On the contrary, since hookworm disease in humans is no longer common in\r\nthis country, we seldom consider the possibility of infection, and most people don’t even\r\nknow what it is, therefore I wanted to share with the readers of this board some facts\r\nregarding the condition. \r\n\r\nFrankly Sara, you have done all of us a great service by posting your experience, because \r\nwe all should be aware of the potential danger.  I spent several years in Asia and on \r\nvarious Pacific islands when I was in my 20’s, and was aware of many tropical diseases\r\nincluding this one, but hookworm is not something I have given much thought when\r\ntraveling to Jamaica.  However, it would be wise to do so since the number of people in\r\nthe world affected by this parasite is estimated in the hundreds of millions.  That being\r\nsaid, I would like to attempt to dampen some of the fear engendered in people’s minds by\r\nthe thought of there being a nasty nematode waiting under the hammock.  It was for this\r\nreason that I made the statement that the condition is easily treated.  That is a statement\r\nfrom which I do not retreat.  Although you and your husband were sick from the\r\nmedication, there IS effective medical treatment available, and the course of treatment is\r\nrelatively short.  Although some discomfort is inevitable, it is nothing to compare with the\r\ndiscomfort from other maladies of the tropical third world such as malaria, cholera,\r\nnecrotizing bacterial infections of the skin, etc.\r\n\r\nOnce again, Sara, thank you for sharing your experiences with us.  Hopefully, your next\r\nvisit to Jamaica will be more pleasant and parasite free.  Also, hopefully we can now move\r\non to discussion of the more pleasant aspects of  Jamaican travel.', 'c0052d1fcb', 3, -1, '', 1151275950, 23, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0, '');
